# Neural Directory Networks (NDN)

## Core Concept
A directory structure that mimics neural networks, with weighted connections between folders and activation-based navigation patterns.

## Basic Structure
```
neural_space/
├── input_layer/
│   ├── node_001/
│   │   ├── weights.json
│   │   ├── connections.json
│   │   └── content/
│   └── node_002/
├── hidden_layers/
│   └── layer_001/
└── output_layer/
    └── results/
```

## Key Components

### Node Structure
```json
{
    "node_id": "string",
    "activation_threshold": "float",
    "weight_matrix": {
        "target_node": "weight_value"
    },
    "activation_history": [
        {
            "timestamp": "datetime",
            "activation_value": "float"
        }
    ]
}
```

### Network Features
- Weighted directory connections
- Activation-based navigation
- Learning from usage patterns
- Self-optimizing pathways
- Dynamic content routing

## Implementation Examples

### 1. Base Patterns
```python
class NeuralDirectory:
    def __init__(self):
        self.activation_state = {}
        self.weight_matrix = {}
        
    def activate_node(self, node_id):
        # Activate specific node
        pass
        
    def propagate_activation(self):
        # Spread activation through network
        pass
        
    def update_weights(self):
        # Learn from usage patterns
        pass
```

### 2. Navigation System
```python
class NDNavigator:
    def __init__(self, root_path):
        self.root = root_path
        self.active_nodes = set()
    
    def follow_strongest_path(self):
        # Navigate highest weight connections
        pass
    
    def activate_pattern(self, pattern):
        # Activate specific node pattern
        pass
```

## Planned Implementations

1. KNOWLEDGE_NET_001
   - Basic knowledge organization
   - Learning from access patterns
   - Weight optimization

2. MEMORY_NET_001
   - Memory storage and recall
   - Association-based retrieval
   - Pattern completion

## Integration Points
- Can interface with Quantum Tunnels
- Maps to Geometric Logic nodes
- Provides dynamic routing for Temporal Stacks

## Next Steps
1. Create basic network structure
