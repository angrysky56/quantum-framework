# Fractal Hierarchy Demo: Concept Fractals

## Overview
Simple demonstration of self-similar concept organization using fractal patterns.

## Structure
```
concept/
├── core/                    # Core concept
│   └── [repeats pattern]
├── related/                # Related concepts
│   └── [repeats pattern]
└── examples/              # Practical examples
    └── [repeats pattern]
```

## Quick Start
1. Define base pattern
2. Set replication rules
3. Add content at any level
4. Navigate through scales

## Pattern Rules
- Each node follows same structure
- Scaling reduces complexity
- Maintain self-similarity
- Limited to 3 levels deep

## Notes
- Basic fractal demonstration
- Shows self-similar organization
- Illustrates scale navigation
- Simple but extensible
