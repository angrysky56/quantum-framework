# AI-Native Architecture Repository

## Overview
Collection of experimental AI-optimized data structures and organizational patterns.
Created: 2024-12-04
Status: Experimental/Prototype

## Architectures

### 1. Quantum Tunnel Directory Structure (QTDS)
- Vertical concept organization
- Depth-based information hierarchy
- Metadata-driven navigation

### 2. Geometric Logic Mapping (GLMap)
- Pattern-based organization
- Mathematical relationship mapping
- Multi-dimensional concept space

### 3. Neural Directory Networks (NDN)
- Weight-based connections
- Self-optimizing pathways
- Activation-pattern navigation

### 4. Temporal Stack Architecture (TSA)
- Time-aware organization
- Version control integration
- Future state prediction

### 5. Fractal Information Hierarchy (FIH)
- Self-similar patterns
- Scale-independent organization
- Recursive navigation

## Implementation Status
- QTDS: Initial prototype created (ESSAN_TUNNEL_001)
- Others: Concept phase

## Next Steps
1. Create demo implementations
2. Test navigation patterns
3. Develop interaction tools
4. Document best practices
5. Evolve based on usage

## Notes
- Each architecture has its own subdirectory
- Include both concept documentation and working examples
- Focus on practical implementations
- Document learnings and iterations
