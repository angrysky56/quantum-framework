# Open Questions and TODOs

## Critical Questions

### 1. IRIS Integration
- How do we map the three consciousness layers to vector space?
- What's the optimal coherence threshold for pattern merging?
- How should quantum tunnels interface with IRIS?

### 2. Vector Space Implementation
- What's the optimal Hilbert curve implementation for our patterns?
- How do we maintain pattern coherence during vector operations?
- What's the best index type for each pattern category?

### 3. System Integration
- How do the discovered systems connect to IRIS?
- What's the proper order of operations for system initialization?
- How do we maintain system state during quantum operations?
